- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaneshAJ
- 👀 The degree that I am pursuing is called as ICT Innovation. It is a two country program. I did my first year masters at TU Berlin, and doing my second year masters at Aalto University. I am interested in Robotics and UAV automation for various applications in the field of Mapping, precision farming and similar fields. I did my bachelors in Hyderabad, India at GITAM University in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my thesis on autonomous drones for mapping and navigation through SLAM and UWB Technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Mapping and Perception Automation for Precision Farming through ground and UAV vehicles, mapping thorugh autonomous drones and swarm UAV technology with localization using UWB.

The Projects I have worked on are listed below.  (Some of the projects are private and will be open sourced soon).

Mapping of Indoor areas through Drones using UWB technology. (Master's Thesis).

SDS Forest Planter. (Based on Autonomous Mobile robots project).

Tracking of an Autonomous mobile robot using sensor fusion. (Based on sensor fusion and particle filters).

Balancing of a segway robot. (Based on Digital control systems which uses MATLAB and SIMULINK).

Robotic arm manipulation. (Based on mechanical manipulation of a robotic arm using a simulator and ROS).

De-Noising of ECG Signals using Adaptive filters. (Bachelor's thesis project, based on digital signal processing, using MATLAB toolbox).
